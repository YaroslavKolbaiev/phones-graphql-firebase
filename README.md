This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application developed using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. TypeScript provides a safer and more robust development experience, making this application more reliable and maintainable.

The application serves as a platform for exploring and purchasing mobile phones. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can browse through various mobile phone models, view detailed specifications, and make purchases.

The client-side of the application is hosted on Netlify, a popular platform for deploying modern static websites. Netlify provides continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network, hence ensuring that the application is always up-to-date and accessible from anywhere in the world.

The server-side of the application is hosted on Google Cloud, a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products. This ensures that the application is scalable, reliable, and secure.

## About the project

The application is built using a variety of modern technologies:

- The front-end is developed using the React framework, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which makes development more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain.

- GraphQL is used as a data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. This allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs, which can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and improve performance.

- Apollo GraphQL, a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL, is also used in the project.

- Firebase is used for authentication and as a NoSQL database. Firebase Auth provides a full-featured authentication system that supports email and password authentication, and Firebase Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development.

- Redux-Toolkit is used for state management. It provides a set of tools that make it easier to write Redux code by including several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases.

- The application's styling is handled with Bulma, a free, open-source CSS framework based on Flexbox, and SASS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.

The application is live and can be visited at: https://serene-maamoul-97d3cb.netlify.app. It offers a seamless user experience, with a clean, intuitive design and a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
